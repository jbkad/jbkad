# Hey, Joyce here 👋🏾

### I'm currently a SWE Apprentice at <i><a href="https://blogs.imperial.ac.uk/imperial-people/2023/04/03/joyce-kadibu-software-developer-apprentice-information-and-communication-technologies/" target="blank">Imperial College London</a></i>. I largely work in JavaScript, builiding digital products to fulfill various business needs. Find out more about my work <a href="https://linked.com/in/jbkad">on Linkedin</a>. 

#### Away from work, my favourite pastime is gliding. Soaring the skies is a great way to destress away from the office ✈️

I'm currently a full-stack Software Engineer at Imperial College London, where I build innovative digital products to meet a variety of business needs. My role involves everything from designing intuitive front-end interfaces to developing robust back-end services. 

I enjoy experimenting with new frameworks, libraries, and tools to stay ahead in the fast-evolving tech landscape. Here are the technologies I've been using lately:

When I'm not immersed in code, I enjoy gliding in my free time, which gives me a unique perspective and  keeps me in sync with nature. Flying not only provides a great balance to my work, but also fuels my creativity and problem-solving skills.
